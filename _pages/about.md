I am an associate research scholar at the Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University.
I am a member of the Data Management team of the [Rubin Observatory](https://www.vro.org/) project and I am in-charge of the software pipeline measuring the signal of weak gravitational lensing from the [Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org/).

Prior to this position, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Sterrewacht Leiden](http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/) (Leiden Observatory), the astronomy department of the [Leiden University](http://www.universiteitleiden.nl/).
I was involved in the research groups of [Prof. Henk Hoekstra](http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~hoekstra/) and [Prof. Konrad(Koen) Kuijken](http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~kuijken/), where I focussed on improving galaxy image simulations for [Euclid](https://www.euclid-ec.org/) and [KiDS](http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/) lensing surveys.


I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Department of Physics](http://www.cmu.edu/physics) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu) in the [Fall of 2016](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/news-events/news-archive/2016/first_graduate_fall_2016.html).
Specifically, I was associated with the [McWilliams Center for Cosmology](http://www.cmu.edu/cosmology), where I worked with [Prof. Rachel Mandelbaum](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/rmandelb) on problems related to gravitational weak lensing.
Visit my <a href="#research">research</a> page to see the problems I am working on and my <a href="files/arunkannawadi_publist.pdf">publications</a> so far.
I earned my Masters degree in Physics from Carnegie Mellon University in the summer of 2013.
I earned my Bachelors degree in [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in) from [IIT Madras](http://www.iitm.ac.in) with a minor in [Physics](http://www.physics.iitm.ac.in/) in the summer of 2011.
