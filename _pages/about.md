I am an associate research scholar at the Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University.
I am a member of the Data Management team of the [Rubin Observatory](https://www.vro.org/) project and I am in-charge of the software pipeline measuring the signal of weak gravitational lensing from the [Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org/).

My research field is Cosmology, the study of origin and evolution of the Universe. I am interested in answering the questions about the distribution of (dark) matter in the Universe, also known as the large-scale structure and using it to understand the contents (dark matter and dark energy) of the Universe. I study the matter distribution using a technique called Weak Gravitational Lensing.

On a day-to-day basis, I work on image processing pipelines and algorithms that work at raw pixel-level data to extract useful information from millions (soon to be billions) of galaxies namely galaxy fluxes (and colors) and shapes.

I obtained my [Ph.D.](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/news-events/news-archive/2016/first_graduate_fall_2016.html) in [Physics](http://www.cmu.edu/physics) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu) in 2016.
