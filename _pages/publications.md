A lot of my research is collaborative in nature due to the complexity of the projects.
A complete list of my publications is below and could also be accessed from any of the links below.
All of my papers are available for free on [arXiv][arxiv_url], which match the published versions.

## Statistics

I do not think that the impact of one's research, based on publications, can be captured in one or a handful number of parameters.
However, if you must know, my **h-index** is 21 (according to [Google Scholar]({{ site.scholar_url }}) and [ADS]({{ site.ads_url }}) and I have been cited over 2200 times.
Three of my papers have over 200 citations and twelve over 50.
